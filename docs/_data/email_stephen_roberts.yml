  Dear Land Use and Transportation Director Stephen Roberts,

  I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Blackberry Grove Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) by Jupiter Power at 21393 NW West Union Road in Hillsboro, Oregon, Casefile #L2500161.
  I urge you to:
  •         Reject the privately owned Jupiter Power’s application for the Blackberry Grove BESS facility.
  •         Require transparent, community-informed guidelines for safe and equitable renewable energy siting in Washington County.
  BESS facilities pose serious risks to public safety, local ecosystems, and community well-being. Lithium-ion batteries catching fire is a common occurrence, including here in Washington County.  These fires release toxic gases and contaminate soil and groundwater.  The damage done is gravely amplified when facilities are sited near homes, schools, farms, and wells.  As an example, the catastrophic BESS Moss Landing fire in California burned for days, causing 1500 residents to be evacuated and releasing toxic gases and heavy metals that contaminated soil and water up to 46 miles away.
  The Blackberry Grove project also introduces potential threats to groundwater and local ecosystems. Over time, chemical leakage from lithium batteries could contaminate wells, and 24-hour noise emissions and lighting would certainly disrupt bird migration, nocturnal insects, and residents living next to it.
  If approved, this project would set a precedent for the rest of Oregon. BESS facilities could be sited almost anywhere—putting forests, farms, wildlife, and whole communities at risk.
  I support renewable energy. But it must also be safe, just, and community-led.  A BESS in a residential or rural area is none of these things. I urge you to prioritize safety, equity, and common sense over corporate profit.
  Sincerely,
