## What is a BESS?

A Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is a battery array that stores energy from the electrial grid during off-peak hours, then returns the stored energy to the grid during peak usage times to help the electrical utility keep up with demand.

BESS facilities are typically situated in industrial zoned locations, but in Washington County, Oregon a BESS is being pushed into a residential/agriculture/farming neighborhood in NE Hillsboro — without safety assurances and without regard for the people who live there.

**Protect our homes. Protect our families. Protect our future.**

We are **No Batteries in Backyards**, a grassroots movement uniting neighborhoods surrounding the proposed BESS location to stand up against this hazardous project. Together, we are demanding safe, responsible energy solutions that don’t put our community at risk.

## Why should I care?

- **Explosion and fire risks** from lithium-ion batteries threaten homes and lives.  
- **Toxic chemicals** released in failures can poison air, water, and soil.  
- **Lack of oversight** means residents are left in the dark about real dangers.  

We refuse to accept unsafe energy storage in our neighborhoods. Clean energy must also be **safe energy**.
