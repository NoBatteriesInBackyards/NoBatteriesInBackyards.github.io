We are parents, neighbors, and community members who believe that **our homes and neighborhoold should never be sacrificed in the name of industrial experiments.**

The energy industry is rapidly deploying large-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) facilities. While energy storage plays an important role in renewable energy, these facilities are being sited recklessly in residential neighborhoods, often with little public input and inadequate safety safeguards.

## Our Mission

- **Protect our communities** from fire, chemical, and explosion risks  
- **Demand transparency** from developers and government officials  
- **Organize neighbors** to resist unsafe projects and propose better alternatives  

We are not opposed to clean energy. In fact, we support it. But **safe siting matters**. Placing hazardous facilities near homes, schools, and parks is unacceptable.

## What We Do

- Research and share information about the risks of BESS facilities  
- Track proposals and alert the community about upcoming hearings  
- Support neighbors in speaking out and organizing locally  
- Connect with other towns and movements facing the same fight  

**We believe in people power.** When communities come together, we can stop reckless projects and demand a healthier, safer energy future.
