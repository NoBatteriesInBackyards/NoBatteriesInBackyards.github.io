excerpt: >-
    Community pressure has prompted Washington County to elevate the approval process for
    Jupiter Energy's proposed 10-acre battery storage facility in rural Hillsboro to a
    Type III review, necessitating a public hearing. We are organizing to contest the
    project and advocacy groups like Save Helvetia and 1000 Friends of Oregon are now 
    actively monitoring the situation and supporting our efforts.
