excerpt: >-
    Jupiter Energy (a Blackrock company) is pushing hard for its proposed BESS Battery Facility in Hillsboro.  The proposed location may have a Hillsboro address, but it is located North of and outside Hillsboroâ€™s Urban Growth Boundary in a farm area not zoned for heavy industrial uses, such as 114 Lithium Ion Batteries, which is what Jupiter proposes to place adjacent to residential uses.
