excerpt: >-
    Residents in rural Hillsboro voice concerns over a proposed 10-acre battery storage
    facility by Jupiter Power, citing inadequate public notice and lack of accessible

    incomplete, leaving neighbors uncertain about the project's specifics and their rights
    and options to respond.
