### What is a BESS?

A Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is a battery array that stores energy from the electrial grid during off-peak hours, then returns the stored energy to the grid during peak usage times.

### Why is PGE interested in having a BESS in Washington County?

Washington County has a growing need for electricity to power our homes and businesses.

### Why are some people opposed to building a BESS in our area?

BESS facilities are typically situated in industrial zoned locations, in part because they are a relatively new technology with a track record that includes incidents of battery thermal runaway, fires that cannot be extinguished resulting in large scale evacuations, and spreading of toxic gasses and heavy mentals into the surrounding area.  Until BESS technology improves and has a proven saftey record, industrial zones are a more appropriate location for BESS facilities.

### Who is Jupter Power?

Jupiter Power is a BlackRock owned company that is driving the proposal to build a BESS facility in a residential area in Washington County, Oregon.

### Who will decide whether the proposed BESS project will be approved?

Jupiter Power's proposed BESS project is being considered for approval by Washington County's Land Use and Transporation Planning department as a Type III procedure.  A public hearing has been scheduled for October 30, 2025, after which a decision will be made by an independent hearings officer.  The hearings officer's decision is appealable to the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals.
